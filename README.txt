===================================
Bosco - Free Orienteering Framework
===================================

Bosco is a software framework to administer orienteering events with 
SportIdent units. It's intended to be as flexible and extensible as
possible.

Bosco has been originally written to administrate the 24h relay in 2007 
in Switzerland. It has also been used several times for the "UBOL 3er Staffel".

In it's current state Bosco is quite incomplete. Use at your own risk
and only after you have verified that it works for your event.
